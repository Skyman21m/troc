The request bears no API key and the default Dart user agent, and the user's IP address. Its JSON-RPC id is `mobile-<microsecond timestamp>-<counter>`, the counter shared, for the life of the app, with the wallet's own calls to the service, which poll its swap orders: so the service can tie a quote to the user's other swap orders. And since a bond's amount follows from an order of the public book, a quote just before a take lets the service's operator guess which order this address is about to take.
  /// Side effects in the wallet: the quote waits behind the wallet's own calls to the service, one at a time; an answer HTTP 418 sets the wallet's « app update required » flag, which stops its swaps until the app is updated.

The invoice given is the one the latest status offered (`walletPaymentFor`); its [CheckedBolt11Invoice.payableUntil] is the one taken.
  /// **Never twice.** An attempt that moved nothing may be tried again, after a new quote and a new confirmation: an invoice is paid again only while every earlier order of the wallet for it (its text, or this feature's order of the same payment hash; any wallet, any purpose) is provably unspent, nothing signed and nothing broadcast. As soon as one may have moved funds (signed, broadcast or after) or cannot be read, the invoice is refused with [P2pWalletPaymentExists] (or [P2pWalletUnavailable]), and is paid with another wallet or replaced by a new invoice: the swap service is paid by a Liquid transaction of this wallet, and a second transaction would send the amount twice, its return depending on the service's refund. Nothing retries by itself. Everything that can be known before the order is created is checked first (the quote, the invoice's time, the wallet, the wallet's own reading of the invoice, the earlier orders, the balance and the coins against the total accepted, the fee); what only the order says (its payin) can still refuse it after its creation, with nothing moved. Two calls at once run one after the other.
  /// What it sends the swap service, through the wallet's own client over clearnet: a JSON-RPC `createOrderSwap` with the invoice itself (its payee, amount, payment hash, description and expiry), the invoice's amount as the amount to pay out with `isInAmountFixed: false`, the two networks, an address of the Instant Payments wallet as the refund destination, and a request id `mobile-<random hex>`; the payin the user accepted stays on the device. Then the funding transaction reaches the Liquid network through the wallet's Electrum servers. #109 tracks the privacy of these calls.
  /// **Trust.** The swap is custodial, as for the wallet's own Lightning sends: the device holds no HTLC and no refund key; once the funding is broadcast, the swap service holds the payin and may pay the invoice, refund the wallet's address, or keep it. The cap bounds what it can hold: the payin accepted.
  /// Every refusal but one means nothing left the wallet ([P2pWalletRefusal.fundsMayHaveMoved] is false); [P2pWalletBroadcastUnknown] means the broadcast was tried and its outcome is unknown: its payment is then followed with [watchPayment] and found again with [findPayment].
  /// It never resumes or retries a payment left halfway by an earlier run: such a payment is reported by [findPayment] and [watchPayment] as it stands.
