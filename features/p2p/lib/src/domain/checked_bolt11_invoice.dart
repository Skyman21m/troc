/// A Lightning invoice (BOLT11) that the trade's state machine decoded and checked for the current status and step, within the amount the user accepted: the only kind of invoice the wallet's port takes (design note § 4.4, #100).
///
/// It is not a decoder. Its one source is `walletPaymentFor` (`trade/wallet_payment.dart`), which builds it from a `CheckedInvoice` of the latest status when it offers « Pay with this wallet » (`WalletPaymentOffered`), with the exact string decoded, its amount, the trade's network, its payment hash and when it stops being payable; the tests' helper of `testing.dart` is the only other caller of [of] (`wallet_port_architecture_test.dart`).
/// What this value checks again by itself, independently of the decoder of #86: the string is at most [maxLength] visible ASCII characters in one case; its human-readable part, up to the last `1` (the bech32 separator), is `ln`, the prefix of [network] (`bc` on mainnet, `tb` on testnet; signet's `tbs`, regtest's `bcrt` and any other prefix are another network, #113), and an amount with no leading zero whose multiplier, if any, is `m`, `u`, `n` or `p` (a `p` amount ending in 0); that amount is a whole number of satoshis above zero and at most 21 million bitcoin, equal to [amount]; the data after the separator is not empty and holds only bech32 characters; the payment hash is 64 lowercase hexadecimal characters; [payableUntil] is not after [expiresAt]; and the invoice is still payable at the time given.
/// The human-readable part is read in three places that cannot import each other: here, by the trade's decoder (`lib/features/p2p_bolt11/bolt11_decoder_impl.dart`, with `Bolt11Network.belongsTo` of `trade/bolt11.dart`) and by the payout's shape check of `packages/robosats` (`checkPayoutInvoice`, #111). They agree on the networks (`lnbc` mainnet, `lntb` testnet, anything else another network), on a whole number of satoshis and on no leading zero. They differ in two ways, harmless here: the trade's decoder caps the amount's digits at 18 (so an amount past that is unreadable there, while here and in the payout check it is refused above 21 million bitcoin), and the payout check accepts an invoice without an amount for its own refusal (`PayoutDestinationNoAmount`), where this value and the trade require one. A change to one is a change to the three.
/// What it does not check: the bech32 checksum, [paymentHash] and [expiresAt] against the string, which the decoder of #86 checks before the state machine builds a `CheckedInvoice`; the signature and the payee, which that decoder does not check (`bolt11_decoder` checks no signature, `trade/bolt11.dart`) and only the wallet's own decoder checks, at payment time, as its library documents (`lib/features/p2p_wallet`); nor the description.
/// Outside `package:p2p` nothing can build one, since [of] is `@internal`. So a string received from a coordinator cannot reach the wallet's port without the state machine's checks.
