/// Pays a checked invoice from the Instant Payments wallet through the wallet's swap service, without a screen: the one place of this feature that creates a swap order, signs, saves a signed payin and broadcasts (#100, step W3; study § 3.3).
///
/// It is money code and triggers a signature: `wallet_shell_architecture_test.dart` allows the names that commit funds in this file only.
/// An invoice may be paid again only while every earlier order for it is provably unspent (nothing signed, nothing broadcast: `WalletPaymentRepositoryImpl.isProvablyUnspent`), after a new quote and a new confirmation; as soon as one may have moved funds, the invoice is refused ([P2pWalletPaymentExists]), so nothing is ever paid twice: the swap service is paid by a Liquid transaction of this wallet, and a second one would send the amount twice, its return depending on the service. Everything that can be known before the order is created is checked first, so that an order is created only for a payment that can go through.
/// The sequence, the same as the wallet's automatic transfers (`ExchangeAutoswapProvider`) from the order on, each step a stop with nothing moved until the broadcast:
/// 1. the quote is this wallet's, given for the same Instant Payments wallet, unused, recent and for this invoice; the invoice is still payable for [invoiceMargin]; the wallet is the default Liquid wallet, on the invoice's network, signing on this device; the wallet's own decoder reads the same payment hash, amount and network, and an expiry [invoiceMargin] away at least;
/// 2. every earlier order of the wallet's records for this invoice is provably unspent, else [P2pWalletPaymentExists];
/// 3. before the order: the balance covers the total accepted, and an unsigned transaction of the payin accepted can be built from the wallet's coins with a network fee at most the one quoted (the quote's own estimate, made again);
/// 4. the order is created with the invoice as its destination, an address of the wallet as the refund destination, and the payin the user accepted as the quoted counterpart, retried once when the service asks to wait, if the wait is short and leaves the margin; the order answered must be this payment's (its note, wallet, destination, environment, amounts and status). The wallet's store answers an earlier active order of the same destination, amount, wallet and purpose instead of a new one when its deadline has not passed (`OrderSwapRepositoryImpl.createOrder`): an earlier unspent order of this feature is then paid on, the cap applying to its payin; past its deadline the store expires it and creates a new order, and the old one expires at the service;
/// 5. the order's own deadline is [invoiceMargin] away at least ([P2pWalletOrderExpiresTooSoon]); the payin the order asks is at most the one the user accepted, the app's own cap, much tighter than the wallet's tolerance of max(1 %, 1,000 sats): else [P2pWalletQuoteChanged];
/// 6. the funding transaction is built at the wallet's Liquid fee rate, by the wallet, to the order's payin address; the wallet's net outflow of L-BTC, fee excluded, must equal the payin (fail closed; the wallet's read does not tell the destination, see [execute]), and its fee and the total must stay within the quote; the margin is checked again;
/// 7. it is signed, saved on the order, the order marked « broadcast unknown », the **saved** transaction broadcast, and the order marked broadcast with its transaction id; a failure once the signed transaction may be saved is [P2pWalletPaymentInterrupted] (nothing broadcast, the invoice closed to this wallet);
/// 8. the handle is returned.
/// Nothing resumes or retries a payment: an order left signed or « broadcast unknown » by a crash is reported as such by the reads of the port, and finishing it is not this use case's.
/// Calls run one after the other ([execute] waits for the previous one), so that two payments of one invoice at once see each other's order, and two transactions are never built from the same coins at once; each step is bounded by [PayTimeouts], so that one call that hangs does not hold the next ones.
