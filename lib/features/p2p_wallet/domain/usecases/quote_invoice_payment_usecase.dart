/// The quote for paying a checked invoice from the Instant Payments wallet: the swap service's payin and fee, the wallet's network fee, the total and what stays.
///
/// It moves nothing: it reads the wallet, asks the service (the amount and the route only), and builds an unsigned transaction to the wallet's own address to read its fee.
/// The service is asked only once the invoice, the wallet and its balance allow the payment, so that an invoice that cannot be paid sends the service nothing.
/// Each quote given is recorded in [IssuedQuotes] with the wallet it was given for, so that a payment takes only a quote this wallet gave, once, from that wallet.
