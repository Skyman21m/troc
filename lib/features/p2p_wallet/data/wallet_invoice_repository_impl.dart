///
/// It is called without a Boltz URL, as `PaymentRequest.parse` calls it, so the binding is given nothing to reach. Anything it throws is [P2pWalletInvoiceUnreadable], with no text kept; this class logs and prints nothing.
/// What it verifies that the trade's decoder (`bolt11_decoder`, which checks no signature) does not: the binding's Dart side documents nothing (it is generated code: `third_party/boltz/api/invoice.dart` of `bull_sdk`); the Rust library behind it parses with the `lightning-invoice` crate, whose `Bolt11Invoice` parsing checks the bech32 checksum and that the signature is valid and recovers the payee's key, as the reviews of #116 read it. Those Rust sources are not in the build's package cache and could not be read here: the signature check is the crate's documented behaviour, not verified in this repository. The binding also reads an expired invoice (it returns `isExpired` instead of failing), so a payment's invoice reads again after it expires.
