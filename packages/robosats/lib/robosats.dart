/// Pure-Dart RoboSats client primitives: the identity of a robot, its OpenPGP key, and the client of the coordinators.
///
/// A [GarageKey] derives one [RobotToken] per robot index, and a [RobotIdentity] holds everything RoboSats derives from a token: the token hash sent to coordinators, the [RobotHashId] with its nickname, the Nostr key and the `Authorization` header values.
/// A [RobotPgpKey] is the OpenPGP key pair of a robot, locked by its token: once unlocked it clear-signs invoices and payout addresses and encrypts, signs, decrypts and verifies chat messages, in the formats of the official client and of the coordinators.
/// A [CoordinatorClient] reads what a coordinator of the embedded [Federation] publishes (`/api/info/`, `/api/book/`, `/api/limits/`) through a [CoordinatorTransport] that the app implements over Tor, and a [FederationBookReader] merges the books of every coordinator.
/// The same client makes a robot known to a coordinator and reads it back (`/api/robot/`), checked against what this device computed: a [CoordinatorRobot] when the coordinator returns the key pair this device has just sent, and otherwise an [UnprovenCoordinatorRobot], which gives the robot only once the robot's token has proved the pair it returned.
/// For the robot of this device, the client also reads an order as the coordinator describes it to that robot (`/api/order/`, a [CoordinatorOrder]), sends a taker's take and cancel of it, and the buyer's payout: a Lightning invoice or an on-chain address, clear-signed by the robot's key ([SignedPayout]), the address first checked by [BitcoinAddress.check]; nothing in the app calls them yet.
/// Invalid input is reported as a [RobosatsFailure] in a `Result`, never thrown.
/// No Flutter, no networking of its own, no logging.
///
/// The client also reads the encrypted chat of a trade as a [ChatPage] and posts to it an [OutgoingChatMessage], which only the robot's unlocked key makes ([UnlockedRobotPgpKey.encryptChatMessageToPost]); nothing in the app calls them yet.
